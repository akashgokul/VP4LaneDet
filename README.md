# Lane Detection using Vanishing Points

This repository provides the code for our CS294-167 final project: Lane Detection using Vanishing Points. Through the course of this experiment, we primarily used Google Colab. The Colab links for our naive one-task network can be found: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g2PUqlCkE_qzPQWWJgNnLV2bGf2KLAu_?usp=sharing. 

Additionally, the naive one-task network code on this file can be run by executing the torch/main.py file. Note, running this github codebase requires: PyTorch, OpenCV2, Numpy, SciPy, and Pandas.

Furthermore, our vanishing point based lane detection model can be found at: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W4dX96ZmzpDaOq_KsI_l5TSfvjtIG0Fd?usp=sharing.
